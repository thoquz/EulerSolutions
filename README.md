# Project Euler solutions

Solutions to [project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.

These solutions are split into two sections:

 * Problems 1-9 (Written in python)
 * Problems 10-14 (Written in Java, project files are in Netbeans format.)

I forgot to upload solution 12. (I can't find the source file, so it might be re-written soon.)


### What can be improved:
For the prime number problems, I resorted to a simple exhaustive search function.
While simple to implement, it is slow. 

There are better methods methods to generate prime numbers, such as prime number sieves.
Examples of sieves that will improve performance is the Atkin sieve (A modern approach) or the Eratosthenes sieve (The classical model of a prime number sieve).
